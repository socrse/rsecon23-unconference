# RSECon23 Unconference

ðŸ”” We are now accepting proposals for session topics for the [RSECon23](https://rsecon23.society-rse.org/) Unconference track! ðŸ”” 

There will be four **90 minute** unconference sessions running in [Track F](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/4430) on the conference workshop day on Wednesday 06 September 2023.

- Session 1: 09:00-10:00
- Session 2: 11:00-12:30
- Session 3: 13:30-15:00
- Session 4: 15:20-16:50

The unconference sessions will be very informal and don't require a lot of planning. Our goal with taking submissions for topic ideas is to provide a place where attendees can see what is being proposed and discuss it in advance of the workshop day on Wednesday 06 September, as well as to provide a mechanism for people to indicate which topics they would actually want and be able to join in each of the four available session slots so we can best schedule topics to slots. Depending on the room size and the number of people who interested in each topic, we may be able to host a few topics per session slot, so please do propose a topic.

Unconference sessions are currently planned to be **in-person only** or **remote only** but cannot mix both in-person and remote attendees as it is extremely difficult to run an effective highly interactive hybrid session without significant prior planning.

## Topic proposals and discussion

Topics can be proposed and discussed here from 09:00 BST Wednesday 30 August to **13:30 BST Tuesday 05 September** (end of lunch on the first day of the formal conference programme).

### Reviewing and discussing proposed topics

Review the [currently proposed topics](https://github.com/socrse/rsecon23-unconference/discussions/categories/topic-proposals) and join the discussion on any that look interesting to help shape the session proposal. Feel free to express your interest with the various emoji reactions GitHub offers. You will get an opportunity later to say which slot you actually want and are able to join in each of the four available session slots (see voting section below).

### Proposing a new topic for discussion

Before proposing a topic, please review the [currently proposed topics](https://github.com/socrse/rsecon23-unconference/discussions/categories/topic-proposals) to see if there is already a similar proposal. If there is, consider joining the discussion on that topic proposal there to see if if might cover what you want.

If there is no exisitng proposed topic that will cover what you would like to propse, then please create a new "Topic proposal" discussion in the [discussions tab](https://github.com/socrse/rsecon23-unconference/discussions/categories/topic-proposals).

1. Choose a short but descriptive title for the proposed topic
2. Write an initial description of the topic, along with what format you expect the topic to take (e.g. a discussion, a co-creation session).
3. Add the session participation type: either **in-person only** or **remote only**
4. List the sessions timeslots for which one of the proposers will be able to facilitate a session on the topic, alongside the name of the proposer who has volunteered to facilitate if the topic is assigned to that timeslot. This facilitator must be able to join the session via the selected participation type (in-person or remote).
5. Save the session
6. Add a label for the participation type
7. Add one or more labels for the supported session timeslots  

## Topic voting

Voting will open at **14:55 BST Tuesday 05 September** (just before the afternoon coffee break on the first day of the formal conference) and close at **23:59 BST Tuesday 05 September**.

When voting opens, please use [this Google form](https://forms.gle/3ujhMx5Waw1xWVbK9) to vote for the topics you are most interested in for sessions you will be unconferencing.

### Voting procedure

- For each session choose the **one** topic that, if it was scheduled for that timeslot, you would attend in preference to any **other option** (unconference topic or pre-scheduled workshop, walkthrough or community event).
- If you would prefer to go to a pre-scheduled workshop, walkthrough or community event in that session, **do not select** a topic for that session.

We also ask that you provide your name and email address so we can email everyone who voted for each topic that is selected to let them know.

The unconference topics seslected for each session will also be added to the information for each unconference session on the [online conference programme](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/4430) by **08:00 BST on Wednesday 06 September** (the workshop day on which the unconference sessions will run).
