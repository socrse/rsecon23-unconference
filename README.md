# RSECon23 Unconference

## Topic proposals and discussion

⚠️ As we only had one topic proposal submitted to this repository in advance, we're going to switch to a more lightweight method for proposing topics and use Slido instead. ⚠️ 

### Proposing a topic
All you need to do to propose a topic is to add it as a question in the "Unconference topic proposals" room in the [#rsecon23 event](https://app.sli.do/event/mwHnJYH3zt11GVLKnUTfvu) on Slido. Please indicate if you are proposing an **in-person only** or **remote only** session.

The unconference sessions will be very informal and don't require a lot of planning. 

Please feel free to still use the [dicussions](https://github.com/socrse/rsecon23-unconference/discussions) on this repository to add more detail about what you hope to do in your proposes session and discuss it with others, but **make sure to add it to Slido first**.

Unconference sessions are currently planned to be **in-person only** or **remote only** but cannot mix both in-person and remote attendees as it is extremely difficult to run an effective highly interactive hybrid session without significant prior planning. Remote sessions will be run via breakout rooms in a volunteer managed  Zoom meeting. This link will be shared on the Wednesday morning on the [#rsecon23](https://ukrse.slack.com/archives/C05GRKZR70C) channel on the RSE Slack and on the session cards on the online conference programme on Oxford Abstracts.

If you see a topic you like proposed as and in-person session and you are remote or vice-versa, feel free to post a duplicate proposal for your attendance mode. It's perfectly ok to have both in-person and remote sessions for the same topic.

### Selecting and scheduling topics
We'll collate the proposed topics from Slido **early Wednesday morning** and, during the coffee session from **08:00-09:00 Wednesday**, will run a physical voting / scheduling session for **in-person only** topics in the coffee area and use the Slido votes and a discussion in the [#rsecon23](https://ukrse.slack.com/archives/C05GRKZR70C) channel on the RSE Slack to select and schedule **remote only** topics.

There will be four **90 minute** unconference sessions running in [Track F](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/4430) on the conference workshop day on Wednesday 06 September 2023.

- Session 1: 09:00-10:00
- Session 2: 11:00-12:30
- Session 3: 13:30-15:00
- Session 4: 15:20-16:50
