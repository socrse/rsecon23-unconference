# RSECon23 Unconference

We will be using this repository to gather proposals for the RSECon23 Unconference track on Wednesday 06 September 2023.

We will be accepting topic submissions from 09:00 BST on Thursday 30 August. We are just finalising the best option for folk to propose topics and support voting without needing to be explicitly added to the repository as contributors.
